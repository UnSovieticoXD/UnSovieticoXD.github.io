    <h2>History</h2
    <p>Machu Music was created on 2023 by 2 Persons:
    <strong>UnSovieticoXD</strong> and <strong>elbenjanub</strong><br>
Because they wanted to make music, they had idols like Fainia Records, so <br>
They wanted to experiment how the music its made. <br>
They went on their computers and on a Discord Call They decided the name, <br> The official name that they decided was "Machu Music" <br>
Â¡And this is the history of Machu Music!</p>
